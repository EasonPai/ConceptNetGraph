Introduction
=========
ConceptNetGraph is a data visualization app for [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/). With ConceptNetGraph, you can browse concepts with visual graph as well as JSON data.

ConceptNetGraph is an experimental app build by [Eason Pai](https://github.com/EasonPai) and is built with
  * [Dart Client] (https://www.dartlang.org/)
  * [StageXL] (http://www.stagexl.org/)
  * [Dart Server] (https://www.dartlang.org/articles/io/) (Host on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/))
  * and a lot of awesome Dart libraries

This app is still work in progress. I'm trying to bring up more fun stuffs.
